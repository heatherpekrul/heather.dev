    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>My name is Heather Pekrul and I'm a software engineer. I specialize in web technologies,
      but I've dabbled in others as well. This site is geared towards those endeavors, but my
      other interests are linked on <a href="https://heatherpekrul.com">my personal site</a>.</p>

    <p>I mainly write code in JavaScript these days, which I have grown to love. Admittedly, it
    took me some time to get there, but it was an interesting journey.</p>

    <p>My first forays into tech were in elementary school before my family even had a computer
      in our home. I was fascinated with computers, and luckily enough my elementary school
      offered an "open computer lab" session before school where any student could come early
      before class started to use the computer lab. I have fond memories of playing
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oregon_Trail_(1985_video_game)">Oregon Trail</a>
      and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munchers#Word_Munchers">Word Munchers</a>.</p>

    <p>In the summer between elementary school and junior high, we got a computer with internet
      access and I spent a lot of time using it to its fullest. I started playing an online game called
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neopets">Neopets</a>, which allows you to create an online
      pet, play games, and create an online page for your pets. Obviously, I quickly realized that
      some people were able to spice up their pages with CSS and I wanted to do the same.
      Unfortunately, I was also exposed to the marquee tag at this time. At least I got it out of my
      system at an early age.</p>

    <p>I recall asking my mom for permission to create a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities">GeoCities</a> page at some point
      shortly after figuring out that I really loved creating web pages, and that I could do so with
      fewer restrictions outside of Neopets. It snowballed when I eventually purchased my first
      domain name in 2004 for the cool factor. My birthday money was able to purchase a year of
      shared hosting, and at that point I was exposed to PHP - which was not, as a teacher mistakenly
      overheard me discussing in junior high, a narcotic but a whole new world of dynamic web sites.</p>

    <p>In high school I began doing freelance web design and development work in an attempt to save up
      money to pay for college. Eventually, I made my way to <a href="https://www.k-state.edu">Kansas
      State University</a> where I majored in <a href="http://www.cs.ksu.edu">Information Systems</a>.
      At K-State, I learned an immense amount about software design, programming languages, networking,
      and more. I still remember some very interesting database design examples invoking memes
      (hi, Dr. Hsu!) and that "caching and locality" was the Hail Mary answer for Dr. Andresen (although
      writing "Go Huskers" on your papers inevitably got you some leeway).</p>

    <p>All wonderful things must come to an end, and as such I graduated in 2011 from K-State and
      went on to the real world where I started writing code professionally. Every day is a learning
      experience just as much as it was in the beginning: but it's something I do because I love it and
      I'm as passionate about it as the day I learned how to add a glitter trail to the mouse cursor
      on my Neopets page.</p>
